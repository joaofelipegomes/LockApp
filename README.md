#  Secure App with Biometric Authentication in SwiftUI


This project utilizes SwiftUI to build a secure mobile application with biometric authentication using the LocalAuthentication framework. Successful authentication grants access to the application's features, while unsuccessful attempts redirect to authentication again. It self-locks during periods of inactivity or when in the background.

To use biometrics, you will need to add **Privacy - Face ID Usage Description** in Project > Targets > Info > Custom iOS Target Properties.
